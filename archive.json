      "body": "In a [composite device](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-rats-architecture-22.html#name-composite-device) evidence is assembled from multiple independent sources.\r\n\r\nAn example is the [Arm CCA attestation token](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0137/latest), which consists of separate (and separately signed) pieces of evidence glued together in an [EAT collection](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-frost-rats-eat-collection/).\r\n\r\nA use case that we want to support is that of a verifier which will not be able to single-handedly appraise the whole thing and will instead carry out a partial appraisal and pass what it's done to the relying party with a clear indication of what remains to be done.  This is not unusual in confidential computing scenarios where the platform verifier can be separate from the workload verifier and they need to be part of a coordinated verification process.\r\n\r\nThe current structure does not cope well with that situation\r\n```\r\nEAR = {\r\n  ear.status => $ar4si.trust-tier\r\n  eat_profile => \"tag:github.com,2022:veraison/ear\"\r\n  ? ear.trustworthiness-vector => ar4si.trustworthiness-vector\r\n  ? ear.raw-evidence => ear-bytes\r\n  iat => int\r\n  ? ear.appraisal-policy-id => text\r\n  * $$ear-extension\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbecause there's only one \"global\" trustworthiness vector.\r\n\r\nOne way to address the issue is to split the EAR into two: a \"core\" object harbouring the trustworthiness vector associated to a specific piece of evidence (alongside other contextual stuff that makes sense on a per-evidence basis), and an outer container that will group the information with \"global\" scope:\r\n```\r\nEAR-core = {\r\n  ear.status => $ar4si.trust-tier\r\n  ? ear.trustworthiness-vector => ar4si.trustworthiness-vector\r\n  ? ear.appraisal-policy-id => text\r\n  * $$ear-core-extension\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\nEAR = {\r\n  eat_profile => \"tag:github.com,2022:veraison/ear\"\r\n  iat => int\r\n  ? eat_nonce = nonce-type\r\n  ear.verifier-id => ear-verifier-id\r\n  ? ear.raw-evidence => ear-bytes\r\n  submods-label => {\r\n    + text => EAR-core ; the submod name is an identifier for the portion of appraised evidence\r\n  }\r\n  * $$ear-extension\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n--- \r\n* 01/12/2023 Edited as per https://github.com/thomas-fossati/draft-ear/issues/10#issuecomment-1380546331\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Either the RP doesn't care about the evidience and only about the verifier's evaluation (AR4SI), or it has an understanding of the scheme.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm suggesting in the footnote is that if this is not true, then there needs to be some sort of standardised \"grammar\" for describing the evidence in terms of it's use, that the RP can then interpret.\r\n\r\n> Providing an in-band, verifier-signed EAR signal that conveys this kind of information seems like a valuable addition in terms of improved transparency of the operations.\r\n\r\nDepends on what is meant by \"signal\" here.\r\n\r\nIf this is just taking about tagging/flagging evidence entries that were used by the verifier, then I don't see how that would add much itility?

Should we have guidance on what implementations should do when a sensible submod cannot be created (e.g. due to an error)?\r\n\r\nErrors generated by a verifier can be broadly classified into two categories: those that caused by the input (the input is either erroneous or cannot be evaluated, e.g. due to the absence of necessary endorsements), and those that are agnostic of the input (OOM, communication failure, etc). The latter are typically communicated via a separate error state as part of the API (e.g. an error return code). The former should be communicated in the attestation result, as they pertain to the evidence submitted, and not a failure of the processing pipeline.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of cases, there is no problem in constructing a valid EAR to communicate the error condition -- if we know what the evidence is supposed to be, we know what the client is expecting the EAR to look like vis-\u00e0-vis the submods it contains. However, in situations where the nature of the evidence cannot be established, and cannot be inferred from context (the verifier can handle multiple different types of evidence), we do not know how to construct the EAR. An example of that is when Veraison cannot match the media type in the request to an appropriate evidence handler.\r\n\r\nIn such situations, the verifier needs to add a \"fake\" submod and populate the AR4SI to reflect the error condition. The question is what name should this submod be added under? This cannot be the submod name the client typically expects, as we do not know what that is. While this can be implementation specific, it maybe useful to reserve a particular name (e.g. \"ERROR\"), or at least have some non-normative guidance in the spec for this.",

Given CoMID is used to define Identity claims, the comid.identity-triple-record is a reasonable structure that need not be redefined. \r\n\r\nar4si doesn't try to limit the attestation results to what is defined in ar4si. For example, the Verifier has a set of claims it has determined are valid based on appraisal, aka `accepted-claims`, that simply can be copied into attestation results. This can be done by making `trustworthiness-claim-map` extensible and re-using existing mechanism for representing claims such as comid triples. This example happens to use `condition-endorsement-triple-record` but others could be meaningful. \r\n\r\nIf for logging / audit purposes the Verifier inputs are desired, the conceptual messages used by the Verifier could be copied into AR as claims entailment. It might make sense to do this on a per claim basis. But if not, it might make sense to extend higher up, possibly at the `signed-ar-map`? \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `signed-ar-map` appears to have triples semantics in that it relates a triple subject, a stateful expression of the authenticated Attester, with a triple object, the set of asserted attestation results claims.  Possibly, it makes sense to model this as an attestation results triple? That would allow more fluid reuse of powerful expressions found in CoMID. ",

Since the vector is a list of thing, there should be a trust-tier for each possible thing.\r\n\r\nI think there's a bit of misunderstanding here.\r\n\r\nTrustworthiness (TW) claims are _\"Specific aspects for which a Verifier will assert trustworthiness [...]\"_\r\n\r\nThe specific TW claims are defined in [\u00a72.3.4](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-rats-ar4si-04.html#section-2.3.4), e.g., configuration, executables, etc.\r\n\r\nThese are the entries in the TW vector.  You can think of the TW vector as either a vector whose slot indexes have specific semantics (e.g., [0] is configuration, [1] is executables, etc.), like this:\r\n```\r\nTW-vector = [\r\n  configuration: -128..127\r\n  executables: -128..127\r\n  ; ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\nor an associative array (i.e., a map, like we do in [EAR](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-fv-rats-ear-00.html#section-3.2.1):\r\n```\r\nTW-vector = {\r\n  &(configuration: 0) => -128..127\r\n  &(executables: 1) => -128..127\r\n  ; ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut that's just an implementation detail.\r\n\r\nEach TW claim is given a trust \"quantum\" in the -128..127 range with TW claim-specific semantics.  (Actually, some quanta 0, 1, and -1 have global semantics, but that's not important here.)\r\n\r\nThe -128..127 range is partitioned into 4 tiers - affirming, contraindicated, ... - and each tier is further subdivided into a standard and private space to allow deployment-specific extensions.  The tier partitioning is nice cos even if the RP doesn't know the exact semantics of a given value for a certain TW claim, it can always map it into one of the four broad categories and design the policy accordingly.\r\n",

      "body": "CoRIM / CoMID triples are expressive structures that contain much of the verifier context already. Verifiers may generate partial attestation results corresponding to subcomponents in a device composition. CoMID triples such as `conditional-endorsed-triple-record` that has logic where given a set of accepted claims, a set of additional claims can be asserted. Attestation results fits this pattern where given a final set of accepted claims, the \"attestation results\" claims are asserted. \r\n\r\nThe EAR structure expects to retain much or all of the verifier's appraisal context in addition to producing attestation results. The corim \"accepted claims\" concept seems to already contain this context. The EAR seems to focus on retaining evidence input to the verifier, but it is unclear if the reference and endorsement inputs are also retained? Given the output of the verifier is a description of the Attester's current or active state, the verifier's \"accepted claims\" set seems to be the most appropriate representation of the current state. It is unclear, outside of audit requirements, why the EAR needs to retain only evidence. It is also unclear, outside of audit requirements, why the original signers of evidence is retained. The EAR description combines the audit requirements with multi-stage verifier requirements and abstracts all the verifier inputs as 'bytes' or 'text' even though the actual inputs may already be available in RIM or tag formats. \r\n\r\nIf CoRIM was used as the omnibus representation of verifier to verifier conceptual message, then little or no changes are needed to support it. The attestation results claims as defined by ar4si seem to be the outliers. However, using a triple similar to `conditional-endorsement-triple-record` the ar4si claims can be appended to a set of accepted claims. E.g.:\r\n```\r\nattestation-results-triple-record = [ \r\n  subj: accepted-claims\r\n  obj: ar4si-claims\r\n]\r\n```\r\nAr4si-claims could be a structure that is based on comid `measurement-values-map` where extensions to this structure can define ar4si specific claims. E.g.,\r\n```\r\n$$measurement-values-map-extension //= (\r\n  ? &(ar-status: -1) => $ar4si.trust-tier\r\n  ? &(trust-vector: -2) => ar4si.trustworthiness-vector\r\n  ? &(appr-policy-id: -3) => $policy-id-type-choice ; since RATS hasn't defined appraisal policies / out of scope\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThe current EAR is expected to be signed but doesn't define the signed container. If CoRIM  / COSE is used, the container signature block can be used to capture signer context such as the `iat` timestamp and `eat.nonce` nonces, or other context that is specific to the signing event. These can be added to the COSE `protected-header` field.\r\n\r\nThe CoRIM signer field could identify the verifier (as it already identifies the container's signer). \r\n\r\nThe CoRIM also identifies the profile that was applied.\r\n\r\nThe CoRIM can identify other RIMs that are needed to construct the device composition and to discover all the needed verifier inputs. This context may be a reasonable structure for informing an auditor also.\r\n\r\nIn summary, CoRIM seems to already have mechanism to address most, if not all, the requirements of an EAR. \r\nWhether or not attestation results should be encumbered with audit seems like an important question for further discussion. It seems reasonable that there could be a system of multiple verifiers, and that the partial results of one verifier should be inputted to a downstream verifier. However, an auditing system might require a first verifier to log activity with a stand-alone audit system rather than rely on a downstream verifier. \r\n\r\nDownstream verifiers might expect upstream verifiers to have fully processed an attestation result for a subcomponent as the \"partial attestation result\". A device composition might be the basis for a layout of verifiers in a multi-verifier architecture. That implies each verifier acts relatively independently. The only consideration for interdependent attestation results is the EAR.status, a.k.a., $ar4si.trust-tier which the EAR draft interprets as being an amalgamation of all the components in a device composition. Certainly, an entity could walk a  device composition hierarchy where subcomponents each have an ar4si.trust-tier result and compute an aggregate trust-tier value based on an aggregation algorithm (e.g., compute the average). It might make sense to leave such algorithms to the Relying Party who is ostensibly already considering ways to manage overall security risk.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, even if the verifier mesh is expected to amalgamate trust \"status\", it would be easy to add another claim for that purpose by extending `measurement-values-map`.  E.g.,\r\n```\r\n$$measurement-values-map-extension //= (\r\n  ? &(amalgamated-ar-status: -3) => [ amalgamation-algid, $ar4si.trust-tier ] \r\n)\r\n```\r\n",

It's also got a few intriguing properties, especially in the intra-verifier use case where the chained verifiers are all CoRIM-based.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that EAR is (by declaration) an EAT-based serialisation, so I am not sure CoRIM is in scope here.  I.e., what you are describing above looks more like a CAR (CoRIM Attestation/AR4SI Results) than a EAR :-)\r\n\r\nRe: modelling the \"accepted claims\" construct.

The definition for EAR implies that \"policy ID\" covers not only what we call a \"policy\"  in Veraison, but also the \"scheme\". Currently, if no additional policy is specified, and the evidence is evaluated only according to the identified scheme, we do not set the policy ID in the result. Should be setting it to a scheme-defined value instead?",

But it should probably go further to specify the EAR nonce the way EAT specifies byte strings like UEID making use of the the JC<> construct and such.\r\n\r\nWe haven't used `JC<>` in EAR.\r\n\r\nInstead we have abstract, \"info-model\" [labels](https://thomas-fossati.github.io/draft-ear/draft-fv-rats-ear.html#section-3-2) for keys and their types that get instantiated into the [JSON](https://thomas-fossati.github.io/draft-ear/draft-fv-rats-ear.html#section-3.3) and [CBOR](https://thomas-fossati.github.io/draft-ear/draft-fv-rats-ear.html#section-3.4) data-models.\r\n\r\n> Probably say that the comparison of the nonce in JSON is only after b64 encoding is removed.\r\n\r\nIf the nonce has gone through a translation, yes.  That looks like a clarification we should add.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The CDDL wasn't powerful enough.\r\n\r\nIt kind of looks like you require all submods to be the same encoding. You don't allow the sort of encoding that EAT does.\r\n\r\nYou are also defining your CDDL from the ground up, replicating CDDL lines, rather than referencing CDDL in EAT, UCCS, AR4SI and so on. I suppose that's OK as EAT does it, but that is sometimes considered bad practice.\r\n\r\nEAT replicates out of necessity that came for a lot of IETF process and accidents. If UCCS/UJCS were defined first and fully as normative, then EAT could have just referenced it. Would have even been better if CDDL were invented before JWT and CWT.",
